# Data Warehousing Project
## Overview
This is a comprehensive data warehousing project leveraging various Azure services to efficiently manage, process, and visualize data. The project employs Azure Storage Account, Data Factory, Databricks, Synapse Analytics, and Power BI to handle data ingestion, transformation, storage, analysis, and visualization, respectively.

## Project Workflow
Data Ingestion: Raw data is ingested from various Github and stored in the Azure Storage Account.

Data Transformation: Used Azure Data Factory to orchestrate data movement and transformation processes and preparing the data for analysis.

Data Processing: Azure Databricks is used to process the transformed data using distributed computing, performing advanced analytics and data manipulation tasks.

Data Warehousing: Used Azure Synapse Analytics to serve as the centralized data repository for storing and querying data.

Data Visualization: Power BI connects to the data warehouse to create interactive reports and dashboards, enabling stakeholders to explore and visualize insights derived from the data.
## Conclusion
This data warehousing project demonstrates the end-to-end process of ingesting, processing, storing, analyzing, and visualizing data using Azure services.
