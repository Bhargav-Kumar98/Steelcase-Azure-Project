# Steelcase-Azure-Project

## Overview
This project leverages a combination of Azure services to streamline  data ingestion, processing, and visualization. By utilizing Azure Storage Account, Data Factory, Databricks, Synapse Analytics, and Power BI, I've created a robust data pipeline capable of handling complex dataset and generating actionable insights.

## Project Workflow
Data Ingestion: Raw data is ingested from various Github and stored in the Azure Storage Account.

Data Transformation: Used Azure Data Factory to orchestrate data movement and transformation processes and preparing the data for analysis.

Data Processing: Azure Databricks is used to process the transformed data using distributed computing, performing advanced analytics and data manipulation tasks.

Data Warehousing: Used Azure Synapse Analytics to serve as the centralized data repository for storing and querying data.

Data Visualization: Power BI connects to the data warehouse to create interactive reports and dashboards, enabling stakeholders to explore and visualize insights derived from the data.
## Conclusion
This data warehousing project demonstrates the end-to-end process of ingesting, processing, storing, analyzing, and visualizing data using Azure services.
